- Strategy is there to tell us what we can and can not to do. It's basically making clear the trade offs we can commit to.
- Don't worry too much about definitions (what is strategy vs principles vs vision etc). The most important thing is that you cover everything
- You should never create a strategy alone. It is a group activity.
- That said, you as the facilitator are the curator.

# Communicating Strategy
- Come up with a catchy phrase that represents the strategy
- At Shopify, we had: All the Commerce as our strategy one year
- Always have multiple versions of the strategy:
	- The quick and memorable version that goes on a poster
	- The 30 second version
	- The 30min version
	- The full write up

> “I once heard a story about Muhammed Ali’s trainer Angelo Dundee. As you can imagine, it was quite hard to tell Ali what to do so Dundee would just wait until Ali did the right thing and then praise it fulsomely. Communicating strategy might be a bit like that. Wait until people say something good about the strategy and then use that. (Where ‘waiting’ means ‘very carefully listening for’)”
