Hey, I sent this to Marc just now - I thought i’d send it over to you guys as well because I really believe it’d be a game changer for us if we add a professional services team to take on some of these integration requests…  This is how we handled integration/feature requests at my last company and it had a huge impact on our ability to sell. Chris, you and I spoke about this in the past and I really think it’s worth consideration.
This is how we did it:
Process
Sales/CS submits request
A product and dev representative met 3x a week for 15 min to review requests and either say Yes or No based on if it aligns with our long term goals and is doable or not
If yes, a technical scoping meeting would happen to identify the full request in depth
Someone internally then puts together a quote on Google Sheets outlining all the specs of the work and assigning an hours amount to complete each part
If the feature was specific for the 1 customer, there would be a maintenance fee charged (maybe a few hours per quarter depending on the feature) for upkeep. If it was launched for every customer, no fee would be charged
Once contract was signed, a team in Belarus would build it, and then it would go through our QA and review process
The cost per hour was $250 as it was a revenue generating initiative, whereas for Lane right now it’s likely just to bring in new business so it could be cheaper
This changed the sales conversation from “no no no” to “yes yes yes” and was involved in closing I believe more than 50% of our contracts
