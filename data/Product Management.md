# What is Product Management?
Product management increases the probability that an organization ships the *right* things at the *right* time. 

# Responsibilities
- **Delivering Value and Impact**: Help to ship products that will positively impact our customers, our users, and the business.
- **Set the destination**: Collect information to decide the destination of the product.
- **Show the Path**: Help your team find and follow the shortest and clearest path to the destination. 
- **Increase velocity**: Up level the team, help them make decisions, remove roadblocks, offer an extra pair of hands, inspire them to ship quickly.
- **Communication**: You are the connector between groups and people, you are there to facilitate communication. Specifically, you are expected to communicate the product goals, strategy, and solutions.

## Delivering Value and Impact
- [[Releasing a product or feature]]

## Set the Destination (Vision)
The [[Product Manager]] curates a [[Product Vision]]. The vision is the tiniest of outputs (a single line to a single paragraph) with a huge impact. 

The [[Product Vision]] lives at many levels, there is no single vision but a hierarchy of [[Vision]]s that grow downwards from the company vision to an individual project vision.

**Important Reminder**: The PM does not have to come up with the vision by themselves. They are a curator of ideas, not the creator.

## Show the Path (Decision Making)
This all comes down to [[Product Decisions]] and specifically [[Prioritization]]. The [[Product Manager]] is responsible for understanding the available information to decide if something should be done and in what order.

- The [[Product Strategy]] is your main tool to communicate and describe the path. It outlines how we will win, what we will focus on, and what we will ignore.
- [[Product Principles]] help us make decisions when we come to a fork in the path with no clear way to decide. They provide defaults to tough decisions and define the type of product we are building.
- Focus on [[Leverage]] (maximizing impact for a given effort) not [[Efficiency]] (maximizing effort for a given impact)

### Inputs
- Data - [[Analytics]]
- Stakeholders - Talking to [[Sales]], [[Customer Support]], [[Customer Success]], [[Leadership]] teams.
- Our Customers - Qualitative research from talking to our customers through [[User Research]], [[Surveys]]. Common outputs include [[User Personas]], 
- The Industry - Look at [[Competitors]], industry reports, 
- Trends - Look at other industries to see the innovations happening

### Outputs
- [[Product Brief]] - A 1-2 pager document that describes the 
- [[User Story Templates]]

## Increase velocity (Execution)
The key word here is **velocity**. Velocity is different from speed, it's a vector that combines speed with direction and you can *add them together*. Your team's impact is the sum of all the individual vectors (the people on your team), you are there to make sure your team is pointed in the same direction to create maximum impact. [^ElonMusk]
