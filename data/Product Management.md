# What is Product Management?
TODO

# Responsibilities
- **Set the destination**: Collect information to decide the destination of the product and team.
- **Show the Path**: Help your team find and follow the shortest and clearest path to the destination. 
- **Increase velocity**: Uplevel the team, help them make decisions, remove roadblocks, offer an extra pair of hands
- **Communication**: You are the connector between groups and people, you are there to facilitate communication.

## Set the Destination
Within this area of responsibility, the [[Product Manager]] needs to focus on creating a [[Product Vision]]. The vision is the tiniest of outputs (a single line to a single page) with a huge impact. 

The [[Product Vision]] lives at many levels, there is no single vision but a hierarchy of [[Vision]]s that grow from the company vision all the way to a project vision.

**Important Reminder**: You do not have to come up with the answers by yourself. You are a curator of ideas, not the creator.

## Show the Path
This all comes down to [[Product Decisions]] and specifically [[Prioritization]]. The [[Product Manager]] is responsible for understanding the available information to decide in what order something should be done.

- The [[Product Strategy]] is your main tool to communicate and describe the path. It outlines how we will win, what we will focus on, and what we will ignore.
- [[Product Principles]] help us make decisions on which fork we should walk. They provide defaults to tough decisions and define the type of product we are building.
- Focus on [[Leverage]] (maximizing impact for a given effort) not [[Efficiency]] (maximizing effort for a given impact)

### Inputs
- Data - [[Analytics]]
- Stakeholders - Talking to [[Sales]], [[Customer Support]], [[Customer Success]] teams.
- Our Customers - Qualitative research from talking to our customers through [[User Research]], [[Surveys]]. Common outputs include [[User Personas]], 
- The Industry - Look at [[Competitors]], industry reports, 
- Trends - Look at other industries to see the innovations happening

### Outputs
- [[Product Requirements]] - Main document here is a 1-pager
- [[User Stories]]

## Increase velocity 
The key word here is **velocity**. Velocity is different from speed, it's a vector that combines speed with direction and you can *add them together*. Your team's impact is the sum of all the individual vectors (the people on your team), you are there to make sure your team is pointed in the same direction to create maximum impact. [^ElonMusk]
