# What is Product Management?
TODO

# Responsibilities
- **Set the destination**: Collect information to decide the destination of the product and team.
- **Show the Path**: Help your team find and follow the shortest and clearest path to the destination. 
- **Get there Fast**: Uplevel the team, help them make decisions, remove roadblocks, offer an extra pair of hands
- **Communication**: You are the connector between groups and people, you are there to facilitate communication.

## Set the Destination
Within this area of responsibility, the [[Product Manager]] needs to focus on creating a [[Product Vision]]. The vision is the tiniest of outputs (a single line to a single page) with a huge impact. 

The [[Product Vision]] lives at many levels, there is no single vision but a hierarchy of [[Vision]]s that grow from the company vision all the way to a project vision.

**Important Reminder**: You do not have to come up with the answers by yourself. You are a curator of ideas, not the creator.

## Show the Path
This all comes down to [[Prioritization]]. The [[Product Manager]] is responsible for understanding the available information to decide in what order something should be done.

- The [[Product Strategy]] is your main tool to communicate and describe the path. It outlines how we will win, what we will focus on, and what we will ignore.
- [[Product Principles]] help us make decisions on which fork we should walk. They provide defaults to tough decisions and define the type of product we are building.

### Inputs
