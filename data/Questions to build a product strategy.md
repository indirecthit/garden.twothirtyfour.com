# Questions
Based on [Jamie Arnold's article Seven questions to build a roadmap](https://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap):
- What are we trying to learn or prove?
- Who are the users?
- What are we operating? - Go beyond the digital experience and consider the entire operations. 
- What are we saying? - What do we want to say about the company? The industry?
- What are our assumptions?
- What are our dependencies?
- What capabilities do we need?

- What do we need to do in the next N months to make the most meaningful progress towards our strategy?
- What key risks do we need to mitigate or eliminate? (e.g. an important customer that might churn, a major systems liability, etc.)
- To what degree do we need to play Offense in the next N months vs. play Defense?
- How important is growth right now vs. protecting what we have vs. laying the foundation for future growth?
- Are we currently in Explore mode with this product or Exploit mode?
- What strategy-aligned efforts will help address the team problems I want to see solved/mitigated in the next N months? (e.g. morale boosting features, execution-enabling "incrementals", frustration-removing technical foundation work, etc.)
- What key initiatives have the greatest Expected Value and what themes do they fall in? (quasi bottoms-up)
- What is largely in my or my teamâ€™s control, on what do we rely on other teams, and what are the risks there?
