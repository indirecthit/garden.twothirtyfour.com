# What is Product Strategy?
- What we will focus on and what we will ignore
- Identifies and prioritizes the problems and solutions we will solve
- It is not a feature list or a list of tactics

A good product strategy has:
- A clear owner
- Everyone is very clear it is not a promise
- A quick summary that people understand and remember

# Elements of a Product Strategy
This is not a required list, choose what you need from this list to create your strategy.
- The goal - What are we trying to achieve?
- The customer and user segments - Who are we going after?
- The value - How the user and customer will get value from our product?
- The business model - How the company will make money (get value) from the product?
- Reasoning - Why this approach? What inputs are we using to make these decisions?
- Time frame - How will it evolve over time? What are the timelines we need to hit?
- The route - The milestones that get us from A to B. This is not a list of deadlines, it needs to be clear how each step moves you towards the destination.
- Risks / Challenges - What can go wrong and how can we prepare for it?
- Won't do - A list of what we we won't be doing. Either goals, customer segments, problems, or solutions.

# Creating a Product Strategy
## Seven Questions to Build a Roadmap/Strategy
Based on [Jamie Arnold's article Seven questions to build a roadmap](https://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap):
- What are we trying to learn or prove?
- Who are the users?
- What are we operating? - Go beyond the digital experience and consider the entire operations. 
- What are we saying? - What do we want to say about the company? The industry?
- What are our assumptions?
- What are our dependencies?
- What capabilities do we need?

With this approach, Jamie argues that you should use a timeline that creates discomfort and forces them to think beyond the immediate deadline. He recommends "3 or 6 monthly intervals over 1 or 2 years."
