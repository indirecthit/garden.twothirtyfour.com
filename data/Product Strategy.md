# What is Product Strategy?
- What we will focus on and what we will ignore
- Identifies and prioritizes the problems and solutions we will solve
- It is not a feature list or a list of tactics

A good product strategy has:
- A clear owner
- Everyone is very clear it is not a promise
- A quick summary that people understand and remember

# Elements of a Product Strategy
This is not a required list, choose what you need from this list to create your strategy.
- The goal - What are we trying to achieve?
- The customer and user segments - Who are we going after? Who are we not going after?
- The value - How the user and customer will get value from our product?
- The business model - How the company will make money (get value) from the product?
- Reasoning - Why this approach? What inputs are we using to make these decisions? 
- Time frame - How will it evolve over time? What are the timelines we need to hit?
- The route - The milestones that get us from A to B. This is not a list of deadlines, it needs to be clear how each step moves you towards the destination.
- Risks / Challenges - What can go wrong and how can we prepare for it?
- Won't do - A list of what we we won't be doing. Either goals, customer segments, problems, or solutions.

## Current State
Assessment of the market, competitors, and the current product (weaknesses and strengths).

## Timeframe
Generally you go with 3 or 6 month intervals over 1-2 years. 

## The Route
### Trade Offs


### Allocation
From [Sheyas Doshi on product strategy](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1320105221570228224). He suggests the highest leverage technique for product strategy is to set key themes and allocations for the next 3/6/12 months. 

For many products, allocations would be across the portfolio. At Google, they did "70 / 20 / 10 % of its time across search+ads / apps / other bets".

At a singular product level, you should look at allocating across the following themes:
- Differentiators
- Tablestakes
- Incrementals
- Embarrassments (or “Broken Windows”)
- Customer Specials (or “Large Customer Requests”)
- Speculative Bets
- Tech Foundation
