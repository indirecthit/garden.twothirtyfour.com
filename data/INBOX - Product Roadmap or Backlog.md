3. Backlog tools
Q: Who here has discovered a way of organizing their backlog that they’re pretty happy with? We're migrating ours to Asana, and starting fresh! Curious what kinds of mental models or frameworks folks here have found success with

– Kali Borkoski

Wayne Vernon: At a super high level, my backlog goals are:

Development work only that is in a workable stage, i.e. can be picked up a ran with by a dev based on the information in the ticket

If it’s dev work but not ready to be worked on, consider setting up an Icebox so your team can ignore it but you don’t lose it

If it’s not dev work but an idea, feature request, etc. instead, it should live somewhere other than your backlog. Plus, schedule intentional time to groom your backlog.

I used to try to do this as part of other ceremonies but it never really worked out. Now I have 30 minutes every 2 weeks where myself, my leads, and QA sort the backlog by last activity and work through closing, updating, etc. as many tickets as possible. It’s infrequent and short enough to not be painful but enough to slowly chip away at all the noise.

Kali Borkoski: Thank you, @Wayne Vernon! What do you do with the tickets that fall in bucket #3?

Wayne Vernon: I personally maintain my own list in a doc (Confluence for us) that I prioritize and add context to. There are definitely better ways to do this, e.g. most product management tools handle feature ideas and requests more natively. Really depends on your “customer” and how visible you need to make these things. For me, I’m not super worried about it so a doc works fine. 

Yair: At Quora we use Asana for tracking backlogs. Each team has its own backlog "project" where tasks are tracked. Teams usually have some cadence where the PMs/eng managers might go through the backlog tasks, reprioritize / potentially delete some / potentially just crank a few out. This is particularly useful ahead of weeks where we focus on product/tech debt and there's time to plow through a bunch of these.

Kali Borkoski: @Yair, Thank you! What are the fields you've added to that Asana board? (Priority, effort, etc?)

Yair: This was team-by-team, but I do think almost everyone has priorities, as well as topical tags.

Karri Saarinen: We are makers of Linear. Our framework is that you add all the new work to the backlog which means that’s only an idea but not committed work yet. Then you can have priorities or a few different categories like icebox, backlog, next that categorize generally how relevant this work is. Then for each cycle (sprint) we just select the work from the backlog to be worked on next.

Overall we don’t worry or groom the backlog too much, we just add stuff and then in the cycle planning select what is relevant to work on next. So backlog is the dump of all the possible work we could do, and cycles define what we actually do. With that thinking you don’t need spent time organizing everything perfectly in the backlog, especially because most of it doesn’t ever get done.

We also have a feature that autocloses issues after x months so the backlogs don’t get infinite. If an issue or bug doesn’t get done in 6mo, it likely never gets done and if it’s important, it will surface again.

Gaurav Chandrashekar: @Wayne, don't you have backlog grooming as part of the sprint ceremonies?

Wayne Vernon: @Gaurav, we follow a fairly casual implementation of agile at our org that is closer to Kanban than anything. Some like to have the “backlog groom” and pre-planning for the next sprint(s) be one and the same. Some alternate these week to week. I’ve personally had better luck setting aside completely separate time where we do nothing but try to revise/expand/close/prioritize old tickets in the backlog.TLDR: I’m not an agile expert or advocate. I generally take a high-context approach where I do what I feel will get the best results from the team and product I’m working with at the time. And I’m fortunate to work in an org that supports this approach.
