# Pricing Study
Pricing Study I was involved in:
- They looked at three segments: customers happy with the service, customers OK with the service, and lost potential deals
- The principles they followed:
	- FairnessÂ - equitable across customers and minimizes the perception of it being a tax
	- Simplicity - Easy to understand, calculate, and to predict in the long term
	- Flexibility - Allows for customers to purchase the exact scope of services they need
	- Value alignment - Price only scales with perceived value delivery by the platform
- They ran some surveys, I can send some of the questions if you want to get into that level of detail for these changes. 

A few other notes:
- Grandfathering - Can keep on the existing plans for as long as they want, add new features to the new plans to motivate upgrades or changes. 
- UX Research - We did a few studies with pricing and found specific terms or features that really resonated with customers, other terms were confusing or not relevant until they were a customer. This drove the design of the pricing page
- Pricing Page - There are 3 different pages you should have: website (public), after the trial, and upgrade flows. Each one might highlight different things or lay out the plans differently.
