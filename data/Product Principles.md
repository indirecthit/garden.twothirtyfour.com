See [Permanent Assumptions by Collaborative Fund](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/permanent-assumptions/):
> Some things are always changing and can’t be known. There can also be a handful of things you have unshakable faith in – your permanent assumptions.

> You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.
> So we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends 10 years from now. When you have something you know is true, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.
