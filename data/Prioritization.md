# Prioritizing "Debt"
Two types of debt:
- Product debt
- Technical debt

Questions to ask on setting the priority:
- Is it necessary? Can the product continue to function with this debt?
- Will it block the work you want to accomplish in the near term? Is there a reasonable work around?

# Frameworks
## Choosing a Framework
## Types of Frameworks
### Brute Force (strongest opinion)
- A meeting of decision makers that get in a room and try to hammer out the priorities
- This mostly comes down to who has the strongest or most persuasive opinion
- Beyond the obvious difficulties with this approach, it's also extremely hard to defend on why certain decisions have been made.

### Value vs Complexity/Effort
Score each initiative by value it will bring to the customer and the level of difficulty to implement.

### Weighted Scoring
Score each initiative against 3-6 criteria, create a score for each criteria. The criteria could be benefits (revenue, strategic, value) or costs (effort, operational costs, risk). Add them up and rank based on the final score. 

Examples include: [ICE Scoring](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/ice-scoring-model/), RICE scoring,

### Kano Model
It helps remove features that customers will be indifferent or dissatisfied at by ranking initiatives against two criteria: 

- The potential to satisfy or delight customers
- The investment needed to implement them

In this model, there are three categories:

- Basic (Threshold) - Things your product needs to be competitive
- Performance - proportionate increase in customer satisfaction as you invest in them. There's a correlation between investment and customer value.
- Excitement - disproportionate increase in customer delight as you invest in them.

### Opportunity Scoring
Ask your customers or team members closest to the customers to rank the importance of several initiatives and how happy they are with the initiatives. Initiatives scoring high in importance but low in happiness represent an opportunity.

One way to approach this is "buy a feature". With this approach, you create prices for each initiative and give a group of participants a set amount of money they can use to "buy" the initiatives. 

### MoSCoW Analysis
Group the initiatives into the four buckets:
- M - Must Have
- S - Should have
- C - Could have
- W - Won't have
