# Tips
## Avoid Gatekeepers
Communication using gatekeepers, or a hub and spoke model, is when communication has to filter through specific individuals to be communicated. For example, the PM might talk to the engineering manager in a 1:1, who is then responsible for sharing that information with engineers via 1:1s. The PM is the single point of contact for stakeholders outside the team, and the engineering is the single point of contact for the engineering team. 

The preferred approach is to create a network that connects as many people together. 

To build connections between individuals, you as a PM, need to facilitate conversations and push others to take on responsibility for them. Rely on your engineer and designer to work together on the user experience without your involvement. Include members of your team in conversations with stakeholders. 

To build stronger connections as a team:
- Communicate to the team not individuals - Avoid 1:1s to communicate ideas. Stop using DMs to talk to individuals. Use team meetings and public team channels to share ideas, changes, and news. 
- [[Documentation]] - Create documentation to make sure everyone (stakeholders and team members) understand the context. This includes meeting notes, a decision log, roadmap, product vision, and more.
