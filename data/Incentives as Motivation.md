# Problems with Incentives as Motivation
**Incentives could push people to make bad (immoral, unethical) decisions.**

> Incentive structures work. So you have to be very careful of what you incent people to do, because various incentive structures create all sorts of consequences that you canâ€™t anticipate.

Similar to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law): "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." This is where incentives drive people to take action that they normally would not take or do not accomplish the end goal. 

## How to avoid these problems?
Use multiple [[Types of Product Metrics]] to determine incentives. Ideally a combination of [[Qualitative Metrics]] and [[Quantitative Metrics]]. The metrics should be selected to counteract a single incentive and the resulting bad behavior.
