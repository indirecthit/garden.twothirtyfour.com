As a product team, we want to collect as much input from our customers and stakeholders. The problem comes up when that feedback does not result in action or feedback, stakeholders and customers lose their excitement very quickly. 

There are three things we need to consider our approach to:
- Collecting ideas
- Filtering ideas
- Providing feedback on ideas
