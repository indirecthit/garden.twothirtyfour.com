As a product team, we want to collect as much input from our customers and stakeholders. The problem comes up when that feedback does not result in action or feedback, stakeholders and customers lose their excitement very quickly. 

There are three things we need to consider our approach to:
- Collecting ideas - The approach to submitting ideas needs to be clear, with the right level of friction.
- Filtering ideas - A principled and policy based approach to filtering ideas so everyone can understand why decisions are made.
- Providing feedback on ideas - Quick feedback on if something will happen or not happen. The idea should not disappear into the void.
