# Why health checks?

# Examples
## Product Team Health Check
- Vision and Focus - Is everyone aligned to the same vision? Do we have time and focus to develop a meaningful understanding to make the right decisions?
- Communication & Transparency - Can anyone in the company determine what the EPD team is doing and the status of it? Are stakeholders involved when they should? Are there information bottlenecks?
- Set up for Success - Do we have the tools and resources we need? Do we have everyone on your pod to build amazing products?
- Quality - Are we proud of what we are building? Does it solve customer problems?
- Resourcefulness - Is there a good sense of urgency to ship? Are we being resourceful, opinionated and saying “no” to the right things?
- Decision Making - Are decisions being made at the right level with an appropriate degree of urgency and discussion? 
- Progress - Are we making progress and shipping quickly? Do we leverage lessons learned to increase our speed?
- Work Environment - Does our work environment gives you the safety and room to learn, take risks, and to push back? Do you feel you are proactive and not reactive? Do you feel trusted by the organization?
- Process - Do we have the right process and defaults in place? Are there gaps 

## Shopify Health Check

- Transparency - Can anyone in the company easily determine why this project exists and where the project is at without needing a meeting?
- Progress - Are we making constant, consistent movement towards shipping this project and achieving our vision?
- Quality - Will we be proud of what we have built? Does it solve customer problems and will it delight them?

## [Atlassian Health Check](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor/project-teams)
Atlassian looks at the following attributes to measure the health of a project team:
- Full-time owner: There is one lead who is accountable for the result of this project. This needs to be someone whose time at least 80% dedicated to it, and who can champion the mission inside and outside of the team.
- Balanced team: Roles and responsibilities are clear and agreed upon. The project has people with the right blend of skill set. Acknowledge that team members can change by stage.
- Shared understanding: The team has a common understanding of why they’re here, the problem/need, are convinced about the idea, confident they have what they need, and trust each other
- Value and metrics: It’s clear what success means from a business and user’s perspective, and there is a unique value proposition in place for the target users and to the business. Success is defined, with a goal, and how it will be measured.
- Proof of concept: Some sort of demonstration has been created and tested, that demonstrates why this problem needs to be solved, and demonstrates its value.
- One-pager: The project is summarized in a one-pager and shared with anyone so that they understand the purpose of the project, and its value
- Managed dependencies: Clear understanding of complexity, infrastructure involved, risks, resources, effort, and timeline. Clear understanding of who we depend on, and who depends on us.
- Velocity: The team is making incremental progress by shipping concrete iterations to stakeholders (and even better to production), learning along the way, and implementing lessons learned along the way, resulting in greater success
