# Why health checks?

# Examples
## Shopify Health Check
- Champion - Multi-tasking is the enemy of greatness. Is there one person who owns the outcome of this project and is dedicated full-time to fighting for it?
- Team - Have we assembled the right team for this project? Are there missing key skills or roles?
- Alignment - Is everyone on the team aligned to the same vision? Is this vision aligned with Shopify? Do we agree on the goals and metrics of the project?
- Keeping score - Are we winning or losing in the pursuit of this project’s vision? Can we tell week by week if the project and team are improving and hitting our original goals?
- Transparency - Can anyone in the company easily determine why this project exists and where the project is at without needing a meeting?
- Progress - Are we making constant, consistent movement towards shipping this project and achieving our vision?
- Quality - Will we be proud of what we have built? Does it solve customer problems and will it delight them?
- Resourcefulness - Is there a good sense of urgency to ship? Are we being resourceful, opinionated and saying “no” to the right things?

## [Atlassian Health Check](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor/project-teams)
Atlassian looks at the following attributes to measure the health of a project team:
- Full-time owner: There is one lead who is accountable for the result of this project. This needs to be someone whose time at least 80% dedicated to it, and who can champion the mission inside and outside of the team.
- Balanced team: Roles and responsibilities are clear and agreed upon. The project has people with the right blend of skill set. Acknowledge that team members can change by stage.
- Shared understanding: The team has a common understanding of why they’re here, the problem/need, are convinced about the idea, confident they have what they need, and trust each other
- Value and metrics: It’s clear what success means from a business and user’s perspective, and there is a unique value proposition in place for the target users and to the business. Success is defined, with a goal, and how it will be measured.
- Proof of concept: Some sort of demonstration has been created and tested, that demonstrates why this problem needs to be solved, and demonstrates its value.
- One-pager: The project is summarized in a one-pager and shared with anyone so that they understand the purpose of the project, and its value
- Managed dependencies: Clear understanding of complexity, infrastructure involved, risks, resources, effort, and timeline. Clear understanding of who we depend on, and who depends on us.
- Velocity: The team is making incremental progress by shipping concrete iterations to stakeholders (and even better to production), learning along the way, and implementing lessons learned along the way, resulting in greater success
