## The Customization Curve
In [The Customization Curve](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/3T-how-much-to-customize-for-a-customer), Aaron Harris writes that you need to find a sustainable level of customization within your product. There is a sweet spot of customization that increases customer happiness while not incurring costs that'll kill your company. 

A few things to keep in mind:
- Goal is to make as many **future and existing** users happy as you can, not the few who are using your product today
- Making users happy is not black and white, no single thing that you create will make everyone happy
