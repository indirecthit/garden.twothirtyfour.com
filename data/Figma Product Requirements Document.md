# How it’s structured
We structure our PRDs into 3 sections that align with the types of Product Reviews we have at Figma: 
- Problem Alignment: Where the PM clearly articulates the key problem we want to solve
- Solution Alignment: Where the team shares the proposed solution by embedding Figma design files and scoping features 
- Launch Readiness: Where the cross-functional team outlines dependencies for launch

#  Problem Alignment
I strongly believe that PMs are uniquely accountable for making sure the “why” of an initiative is well-defined and well-understood. So often I’ve seen a team spend a ton of time designing a solution only to have the very premise of the problem it’s solving challenged at the very end. For this reason, I think just as much time should be spent defining the problem as determining the solution, as this saves everyone time in the long run.

I’m not going to dive into what’s the right way to write a problem statement as there are enough blog posts about that on the Internet. Rather, I want to share some additional color I like to include when defining the problem:
- Ask “why” one more time than you think you need. Don’t just explain why you’re proposing this project; ask why the problem is important in the first place. Or why the problem even exists, to ensure you’re not simply describing a symptom of a deeper problem.
- Optimize for eliciting a meaningful reaction. Sometimes a reader won’t give great feedback on your problem because it “sounds good in the abstract,” but it’s unclear what core assumptions underlie this problem, or how severe you think the problem really is (since, at some level, everything can be described as a problem). This is why the “High-level Approach” section is important—it can quickly give a sense of scope and lets the reader imagine what a prospective solution might look like, which for many is easier to react to.
- State all your goals, even those immeasurable. Sometimes, the insistence on having only perfectly measurable goals and KPIs prevents you from clearly explaining what you’re trying to achieve. Simply describing what you want users to think, feel, and do can be an important first step in defining what success looks like.

# Solution Alignment
At Figma, we find presenting solutions via a couple different lenses to be most helpful: key features and user flows. 
- User flows are the easiest way for readers to understand the project because it shows how the customer will ultimately experience it. 
- Key features is a quick way for other functions like marketing or product education to understand how we might talk about the initiative with our customers.

# Launch Readiness
In this last section, we create a checklist of considerations you want all teams to make before actually launching a feature. Your project may have unintended legal consequences or important marketing implications, and this list is intended to flag the right stakeholders at the right time—and define criteria for launch readiness—so everyone can plan accordingly, well ahead of time.
