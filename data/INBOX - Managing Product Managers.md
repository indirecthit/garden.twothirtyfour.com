# Measuring Success

## Product Performance
Difficult to measure because:
- Long time horizon to know if they are successful
- Not directly attributable, could be other factors
- Inherited products have limited options to succeed  

## Collaboration
- Doesn't matter on the outputs, only the outcomes. If the backlog looks disorganized but the team feels it's organized, that's OK.

## Decision Making
- Dive deep with the PM on the decisions they have made, and get them to defend the decisions

## Strategic Thinking


# Coaching

## Advising
-   How would you like to be supported? 
-   When things go well, what recognition would you like?
-   What kind of feedback is most useful for you?
-   If you woke up tomorrow and we had a fantastic relationship, how would you know? What would you be doing? What would I be doing?
-   How should we communicate when we disagree about the right steps to move forward?

## Decisions
-   What are the decisions based on? 
-   How did past decisions perform?
-   Which decisions are being made now and are we aligned on them?
-   How will we know if a decision was good or not?
