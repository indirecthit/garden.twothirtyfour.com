An organization is a collection of people working toward a shared goal. It gets the right people in the right places, empowers them to make decisions, and holds them accountable for their results. [^Elegant]

# Designing an Organization
- If a problem needs to be solved quickly, design a process or [[Policies]].
- If a problem can be solved slowly, design your culture.

## Organization Hierarchy
> The opposite of top-down is not bottom-up, but outside-in.

- The Law of Organizational Entropy: Roles and responsibilities drift towards sameness unless acted upon by an opposing force.
- As an organization grows, folks either:
	- don't feel empowered to make a decision because they are concerned of stepping on someone's toes (nothing gets done)
	- everyone tries to make a decision but in opposite directions (nothing gets done)
