\- Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini

- Incentives can tempt good people to push the boundaries farther than they’d ever imagine.
- 
- Ignoring or underestimating the full range of potential consequences, especially tail events that seem rare but have catastrophic effects.
- Lots of little errors compound into something huge.
- Probability is hard. Black-and-white outcomes are more intuitive.
- Underestimating the need for room for error, not just financially but mentally.
- Underestimating adaptation, both present and future, leaving you convinced that history will repeat itself and bitter when it doesn’t.
- Being influenced by the actions of people who are playing a different game than you are.
- An inability to know how you’ll respond to stress causes you to take risks you think you can handle but you’ll actually regret when they turn on you.
- Too much extrapolation of past successes leads to overconfidence, stubbornness, and a narrow view of future risks.
- Wrongly assuming that the information you have at your disposal tells a complete picture of what you’re dealing with. 
- Misreading the cause of others’ successes or failures in a way that tempts you to overemphasize parts of their strategy when attempting to copy what they did.
