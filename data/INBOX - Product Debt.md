There are two ways that product debt happens:
- When you didn't plan for a future (diagram with arrows going every direction)
- When the future you planned for is not the future you find yourself in. (diagram with an error towards one point but the current is another direction)



- Accomodate for the unknown future, but when you get to the future it's different from what you expected
- That divergene is product debt
- The future you plan for is different from your future


When to refactor product
- Need a growth/marketing/sales engine that will keep going
- You are confident on your product
